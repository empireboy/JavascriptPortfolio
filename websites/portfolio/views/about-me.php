                My name is Casper Meloen and I'm a student at Mediacollege Amsterdam. I started gaining interest
                in Game Development when I was 10 years old. I'm using a program called GameMaker for over 6 years
                now.

                In my life as a student i'm learning new programs and languages.
                The languages I use are
                GML (Game Maker Language), C#, C++, javascript, HTML and CSS.

                In my free time I work on my own projects using Unity or GameMaker. I'm also learning other programs
                for video editing, modelling, creating animations and creating music.

                Im very interested in small projects, building a game from scratch, from start to finish.
                I would love to work with a small team and go trough the full progress of designing a game.

              for video editing and creating music. I love almost everything about making games. There are things such as shaders that I don't have much experience with, but
              maybe that will change in the future, who knows!

              Bigger projects can always be discussed.
              My dream is to make a popular game myself or with a small team. It can be a small game like Flappy Bird that
              everyone knows about, but it can also be a fun online multiplayer game, who knows.
